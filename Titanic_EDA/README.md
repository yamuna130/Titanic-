# 🧠 Titanic Survival Prediction Project

This project analyzes and predicts survival outcomes using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
It includes data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling.

## 📁 Files Included
- `1_load_data.py`: Load and preview raw data
- `2_clean_data.py`: Handle missing values and drop unnecessary columns
- `3_eda.py`: Visualize survival patterns
- `4_feature_engineering.py`: Encode and create new features
- `5_model_training.py`: Train and evaluate ML models
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## 💾 Dataset
Use `train.csv` from the [Kaggle Titanic Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and place it in this folder.

## ▶️ How to Run
Run each script in the order:
1. `1_load_data.py`
2. `2_clean_data.py`
3. `3_eda.py`
4. `4_feature_engineering.py`
5. `5_model_training.py`

## 📊 Model Performance
- Logistic Regression: ~79% accuracy
- Random Forest: ~83% accuracy

## 🔧 Install Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
